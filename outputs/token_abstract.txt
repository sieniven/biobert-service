1: [CLS] People adjust their learning rate rational ##ly according to local environmental statistics and ca ##li ##bra ##te such adjustments based on the broader statistical context . To date , no theory has captured the observed range of adaptive learning behaviors or the complexity of its neural co ##rrel ##ates . Here , we attempt to do so using a neural network model that learns to map an internal context representation onto a behavioral response via supervised learning . The network shifts its internal context upon receiving supervised signals that are mi ##sma ##tched to its output , thereby changing the state to which feedback is associated . A key feature of the model is that such state transitions can either increase learning or decrease learning depending on the duration over which the new state is maintained . Su ##sta ##ined state transitions that occur after change ##points facilitate faster learning and mimic network re ##set phenomena observed in the brain during rapid learning . In contrast , state transitions after one - off out ##lier events are short - lived , thereby limiting the impact of out ##lying observations on future behavior . State transitions in our model provide the first me ##chan ##istic interpretation for bid ##ire ##ctional learning signals , such the p ##30 ##0 , that relate to learning differential ##ly according to the source of surprising events and may also shed light on disc ##re ##pan ##t observations regarding the relationship between trans ##ient pupil di ##lation ##s and learning [SEP]

We detect a large proportion of differential ##ly expressed genes ( DE ##G ##s ) underlying adaptation of each replica ##te e ##cot ##ype pair , with a striking ##ly low amount of shared DE ##G ##s across pairs . Fun ##ctional en ##rich ##ment of DE ##G ##s reveals that the traits affected by diver ##gent gene expression are the same across e ##cot ##ype pairs , in strong contrast to the non - shared genetic basis .

Orchestra ##tion of complex behaviour ##s requires communication between brain regions , but how neural activity dynamics are organised to facilitate reliable transmission is not well understood . We studied this process directly by generating neural activity that prop ##aga ##tes between brain regions and drives behaviour , allowing us to assess how populations of neurons in sensory cortex cooperate to transmit information .

Flow shear stress on vein walls has been set forth as the local driver for this continuous adaptation .

The lack of need to use multiple software , p ##eptide information , such as PD ##B file , as well as knowing the second and third structures of proteins are the advantages of this model besides its high accuracy and speed .

This has been interpreted to indicate that heat capacity is a fundamental property of native proteins that provides important information on molecular structure and stability . Heat capacities for both proteins and DNA has been suggested to be related to universal effects of h ##yd ##ration / so ##l ##vation on native structures . Here we report on results from thermal den ##at ##uration analysis of two well - known proteins , human serum album ##in and l ##ys ##oz ##yme , and a short DNA hair ##pin . The transition heat capacities at the T ##m for the three molecules were quantitative ##ly evaluated by differential scanning ca ##lor ##ime ##try . When normal ##ized per gram rather than per m ##ol the transition heat capacities were found to be precisely equivalent . This observation for the transition heat capacities of the proteins is consistent with previous reports .

Further analysis of the collected data suggested a mass dependence of h ##yd ##ration effects on thermal den ##at ##uration that is preserved at the individual protein amino acid and DNA base levels .

This study investigate ##s how much information can be stored in the sizes of den ##dr ##itic spines , and whether is it optimal in any sense ? It is shown here , using empirical data for several ma ##mmal ##ian brains across different regions and physiological conditions , that den ##dr ##itic spines nearly ma ##xi ##mize en ##tropy contained in their volumes and surface areas for a given mean size . This result is essentially independent of the type of a fitting distribution to size data , as both short - and heavy - tailed distributions yield similar nearly 100 % information efficiency in the majority of cases , although heavy - tailed distributions slightly better fit the data . On average , the highest information is contained in spine volume , and the lowest in spine length or spine head diameter . Depending on a species and brain region , a typical spine can en ##code between 6 . 1 and 10 . 8 bits of information in its volume , and 3 . 1 - 8 . 1 bits in its surface area .

To date , no theory has captured the observed range of adaptive learning behaviors or the complexity of its neural co ##rrel ##ates .

The network shifts its internal context upon receiving supervised signals that are mi ##sma ##tched to its output , thereby changing the state to which feedback is associated . A key feature of the model is that such state transitions can either increase learning or decrease learning depending on the duration over which the new state is maintained .

Important ##ly , the calculation of the LL ##R ##2 leverage ##s biological databases that document known interactions amongst genes ; this information is automatically used to define inform ##ative prior distributions on the O ##DE model ' s parameters . As a result , the LL ##R ##2 is a biological ##ly - informed metric that can be used to identify clusters or networks of functional ##ly - related genes with co - moving or time - delayed expression patterns . We then derive data - driven shrink ##age parameters from Stein ' s un ##bia ##sed risk estimate that optimal ##ly balance the O ##DE model ' s fit to both data and external biological information .

These he ##tero ##di ##mers interact at two interfaces : ( 1 ) the in ##tra - dim ##er interactions between E ##2 and E ##1 of the same he ##tero ##di ##mer , and ( 2 ) the inter - dim ##er interactions between E ##2 of one he ##tero ##di ##mer and E ##1 of the adjacent he ##tero ##di ##mer ( E ##1 ' ) .

33: [CLS] The brains of higher organisms are composed of an ##ato ##mic ##ally and functional ##ly distinct regions performing specialised tasks ; but regions do not operate in isolation . Orchestra ##tion of complex behaviour ##s requires communication between brain regions , but how neural activity dynamics are organised to facilitate reliable transmission is not well understood . We studied this process directly by generating neural activity that prop ##aga ##tes between brain regions and drives behaviour , allowing us to assess how populations of neurons in sensory cortex cooperate to transmit information .

Mi ##ce are housed either in groups or alone in standard cage ##s during which they show a variety of different behaviors . Moreover , housing conditions might alter the behavior of the mice as do social interactions . When given access to running wheels as an environmental en ##rich ##ment , mice tend to run long distances prefer ##ential ##ly during their dark cycle . However , it is currently not well understood whether and how mice utilize running wheels when single - housed or group - housed . Here we developed a low - cost running wheel data acquisition system to study running in adult C ##5 ##7 ##BL / 6 mice at high temporal resolution under different social conditions . As expected , adult C ##5 ##7 ##BL / 6 mice prefer to run in stretches during the dark cycle and mostly rest during the light cycle .

In this manuscript , we provide a detailed description of an algorithm and a lightweight Java application to automatically analyze single DNA molecule images we call " DNA size find ##er " . DNA size find ##er significantly simplified the analysis of the experimental data while increasing reliability by the standardized measurement of a greater number of DNA molecules .

Analysis of the neutral ##ization of O ##mic ##ron spike protein - pseudo ##type ##d lent ##iv ##ir ##uses showed a 26 - fold relative resistance ( compared to D ##6 ##14 ##G ) to neutral ##ization by con ##vale ##scent se ##ra and 26 - 34 - fold resistance to P ##fi ##zer B ##NT ##16 ##2 ##b ##2 and Modern ##a vaccine - el ##icit ##ed antibodies following two im ##mu ##ni ##zation ##s .

56: [CLS] Public health surveillance , drug treatment development , and optimization of im ##mu ##nological interventions all depend on understanding path ##ogen adaptation , which differ for specific path ##ogen ##s . SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 is an exceptionally successful human path ##ogen , yet complete understanding of the forces driving its evolution is lacking . Here , we leverage ##d almost four million SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 sequences originating mostly from non - v ##ac ##cin ##ated naive patients to investigate the impact of functional constraints and natural immune pressures on the sequence diversity of the SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 genome . Overall , we showed that the SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 genome is under strong and in ##tens ##ifying levels of pu ##ri ##fying selection with a minority of sites under divers ##ifying pressure . With a particular focus on the spike protein , we showed that sites under selection were critical for protein stability and virus fitness related to increased in ##fect ##ivity and / or reduced neutral ##ization by con ##vale ##scent se ##ra . We investigated the genetic diversity of SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 B and T cell e ##pit ##ope ##s and determined that the currently known T cell e ##pit ##ope sequences were highly conserved . Outside of the spike protein , we observed that mutations under selection in variants of concern can be associated to beneficial outcomes for the virus . Alto [SEP]

We applied un ##su ##per ##vise ##d cluster analysis to the SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 genome ##s , assessing their similarity at a genome - wide level based on the J ##ac ##card index and principal component analysis . Our analysis results show that the o ##mic ##ron variant sequences are most similar to sequences that have been submitted early in the pan ##de ##mic around January 2020 . Furthermore , the o ##mic ##ron variants in G ##IS ##A ##ID are spread across the entire range of the first principal component , suggesting that the strain has been in circulation for some time .

58: [CLS] Background : Low - rank approximation is a very useful approach for interpret ##ing the features of a correlation matrix ; however , a low - rank approximation may result in est ##imation far from zero even if the corresponding original value was far from zero . In this case , the results lead to mi ##sin ##ter ##p ##reta ##tion . Method ##s : To overcome these problems , we propose a new approach to estimate a sparse low - rank correlation matrix based on threshold values combined with cross - valid ##ation . In the proposed approach , the M ##M algorithm was used to estimate the sparse low - rank correlation matrix , and a grid search was performed to select the threshold values related to sparse est ##imation . Results : Through numerical simulation , we found that the F ##PR and average relative error of the proposed method were superior to those of the tandem approach . For the application of micro ##arra ##y gene expression , the F ##PR ##s of the proposed approach with d = 2 , 3 , and 5 were 0 . 128 , 0 . 139 , and 0 . 197 , respectively , while F ##PR of the tandem approach was 0 . 285 . Con ##c ##lusion ##s : We propose a novel approach to estimate sparse low - rank correlation matrix .

59: [CLS] The phase transition temperature ( T ##t ) prediction of the El ##ast ##in - like p ##oly ##pe ##pt ##ides ( E ##LP ##s ) is not trivial because it is related to complex sets of variables such as composition , sequence length , h ##ydro ##phobic characterization , h ##ydro ##phi ##lic characterization , the sequence order in the fused proteins , link ##ers and trailer construct ##s . In this paper , two unique quantitative models are presented for the prediction of the T ##t of a family of E ##LP ##s that could be fused to different proteins , link ##ers , and trailers . The lack of need to use multiple software , p ##eptide information , such as PD ##B file , as well as knowing the second and third structures of proteins are the advantages of this model besides its high accuracy and speed . One of our models could predict the T ##t values of the fused E ##LP ##s by entering the protein , link ##er , and trailer features with R ##2 = 99 % . Also , another model is able to predict the T ##t value by entering the fused protein feature with R ##2 = 96 % .

64: [CLS] Since the outbreak of the CO ##VI ##D - 19 pan ##de ##mic , widespread infections have allowed SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 to evolve in human , leading to the emergence of multiple circulating variants . Some of these variants show increased resistance to vaccine ##s , con ##vale ##scent plasma , or mon ##oc ##lon ##al antibodies . In particular , mutations in the SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 spike have drawn attention . To facilitate the isolation of neutral ##izing antibodies and the monitoring the vaccine effectiveness against these variants , we designed and produced bio ##tin - labeled molecular probe ##s of variant SA ##RS - Co ##V - 2 spikes and their sub ##dom ##ain ##s , using a structure - based construct design that incorporated an N - terminal pu ##rification tag , a specific amino acid sequence for pro ##te ##ase c ##lea ##vage , the variant spike - based region of interest , and a C - terminal sequence targeted by bio ##tin l ##iga ##se .

To better understand mit ##otic cell growth and composition ##al changes , we develop a single - cell approach for monitoring dry mass and the density of that dry mass every ~ 75 seconds with 1 . 3 % and 0 . 3 % measurement precision , respectively .

On the one hand , each bottle ##neck reduces the genetic variation that fuels adaptation .

We further show that trans ##genic expression of T ##AA ##R ##5 specifically in o ##lf ##actor ##y sensory neurons rescue ##s aggressive behaviors in knockout mice , despite extensive re ##ma ##pping of T ##AA ##R ##5 projections to the o ##lf ##actor ##y bulb . Our results identify a specific main o ##lf ##actor ##y input that detect ##s a prominent male - specific odor to induce inter - male aggression in a ma ##mmal ##ian species and reveal that apparently inn ##ate behavioral responses are independent of pattern ##ed g ##lo ##mer ##ular input to the o ##lf ##actor ##y [SEP] 
104: [CLS] The spine apparatus is a special ##ization of the ne ##uron ##al ER in den ##dr ##itic spines consisting of stacks of inter ##connected c ##ister ##ns separated by a dense matrix . S ##yna ##pt ##op ##od ##in , a specific act ##in binding protein of the spine apparatus , is essential for its formation , but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown . We show that s ##yna ##pt ##op ##od ##in , when expressed in fi ##bro ##blast ##s , forms act ##in - rich structures with connections to the ER , and that an ER - te ##ther ##ed s ##yna ##pt ##op ##od ##in assemble ##s into liquid con ##den ##sat ##es . We also identified protein neighbors of s ##yna ##pt ##op ##od ##in in spines by in v ##ivo proximity bio ##tin ##yla ##tion . We valid ##ated a small subset of such proteins and showed that they co - assemble with s ##yna ##pt ##op ##od ##in in living cells . One of them is P ##dl ##im ##7 , an act ##in binding protein not previously identified in spines , and we show its precise co ##loc ##ali ##zation with s ##yna ##pt ##op ##od ##in . We suggest that the matrix of the spine apparatus has the property of a liquid protein con ##den ##sat ##e generated by a multi ##p ##licity of low affinity interactions . [SEP] 
105: [CLS] Long - term information associated with ne ##uron ##al memory resides in den ##dr ##itic spines . However , spines can have a limited size due to metabolic and ne ##uro ##ana ##tom ##ical constraints , which should effectively limit the amount of encoded information in ex ##ci ##tat ##ory s ##yna ##pse ##s . This study investigate ##s how much information can be stored in the sizes of den ##dr ##itic spines , and whether is it optimal in any sense ? It is shown here , using empirical data for several ma ##mmal ##ian brains across different regions and physiological conditions , that den ##dr ##itic spines nearly ma ##xi ##mize en ##tropy contained in their volumes and surface areas for a given mean size . This result is essentially independent of the type of a fitting distribution to size data , as both short - and heavy - tailed distributions yield similar nearly 100 % information efficiency in the majority of cases , although heavy - tailed distributions slightly better fit the data . On average , the highest information is contained in spine volume , and the lowest in spine length or spine head diameter . Depending on a species and brain region , a typical spine can en ##code between 6 . 1 and 10 . 8 bits of information in its volume , and 3 . 1 - 8 . 1 bits in its surface area .

106: [CLS] Micro ##bial e ##uka ##ryo ##tes display a stunning diversity of feeding strategies , ranging from general ##ist predators to highly specialised parasite ##s . The un ##ice ##ll ##ular pro ##top ##last feeder ##s represent a fascinating me ##chan ##istic intermediate , as they penetrate other e ##uka ##ryo ##tic cells ( algae , fungi ) like some parasite ##s , but then de ##vour their cell contents by p ##ha ##go ##cy ##tosis . Besides prey recognition and attachment , this complex behaviour involves the local , pre - p ##ha ##go ##cy ##to ##tic dissolution of the prey cell wall , which results in well - defined per ##fo ##rations of species - specific size and structure . Yet , the molecular processes that enable pro ##top ##last feeder ##s to overcome cell walls of diverse bio ##chemical composition remain unknown . We used the flag ##ella ##te Or ##ci ##rap ##tor a ##gi ##lis ( V ##iri ##dira ##pt ##ori ##dae , R ##hi ##zar ##ia ) as a model pro ##top ##last feeder , and applied differential gene expression analysis to examine its penetration of green al ##gal cell walls .

107: [CLS] Inter ##actions between bio ##mo ##le ##cule ##s are characterized by both where they occur and how they are organized , e . g . , the alignment of lip ##id molecules to form a membrane . However , spatial and angular information are mixed within the image of a fluorescent molecule - the micro ##sco ##py ' s dip ##ole spread function ( DS ##F ) . We demonstrate the p ##ix ##OL algorithm for simultaneously op ##ti ##mizing all p ##ixel ##s within a phase mask to produce an engineered Green ' s tensor - the dip ##ole extension of point - spread function engineering .

108: [CLS] In the z ##eb ##ra ##fish lateral line system , inter ##ne ##uro ##mas ##t cells ( IN ##Cs ) between ne ##uro ##mas ##ts are normally kept q ##ui ##es ##cent by underlying Sc ##hwa ##nn cells ( S ##WC ##s ) . Upon severe injuries that cause the complete loss of an entire N ##M , IN ##Cs can occasionally differentiate into N ##Ms but how they escape from the in ##hibition by S ##WC ##s is still unclear . Using a genetic / chemical method to specifically a ##bla ##te a ne ##uro ##mas ##t , we found a small portion of larvae can re ##generate a new ne ##uro ##mas ##t , but the regeneration was hind ##ered by in ##hibit ##ing mac ##rop ##hage ##s . We also demonstrated that the in ##hibition of mac ##rop ##hage can reduce the percentage of tail fin - am ##put ##ated larvae to re ##generate a new N ##M . By in to ##to imaging , we further discovered he ##tero ##gene ##ities in mac ##rop ##hage behavior and distribution along lateral line . We witnessed the crawling of mac ##rop ##hage ##s in between injured lateral line and S ##WC ##s during regeneration and also in between the second p ##rim ##ord ##ium and the first mature lateral line during development . It implies that mac ##rop ##hage ##s may physically separate and alleviate the in ##hibition from p ##LL ##n and S ##WC ##s to break the q ##ui ##es [SEP]

Traditionally , scale - down systems at the laboratory scale are used to analyze the effects of flu ##ct ##uating pH values on strain and thus process performance .

110: [CLS] DNA has emerged as a powerful substrate for programming information processing machines at the na ##nos ##cale . Among the DNA computing primitive ##s used today , DNA strand displacement ( DS ##D ) is arguably the most popular , with DS ##D - based circuit applications ranging from disease diagnostic ##s to molecular artificial neural networks . The output ##s of DS ##D circuits are generally read using flu ##ores ##cence s ##pect ##ros ##copy . However , due to the spectral overlap of typical small - molecule fluorescent reporters , the number of unique output ##s that can be detected in parallel is limited , requiring complex optical setup ##s or spatial isolation of reactions to make output bandwidth ##s s ##cal ##able .

We show that engineered reporter probe ##s can be detected and classified with high accuracy at the single - molecule level directly from raw na ##no ##pore signals using deep learning . We then demonstrate this method ' s utility in multiple ##xed detection of clinical ##ly relevant micro ##RNA sequences .

111: [CLS] Several international consort ##ia are collaborating to construct a human reference at ##las , which is a comprehensive , high - resolution , three - dimensional at ##las of all the cells in the healthy human body . Laboratories around the world are collecting tissue specimens from donors varying in sex , age , ethnicity , and body mass index . However , integrating and harm ##oni ##zing tissue data across 20 + organs and more than 15 bulk and spatial single - cell ass ##ay types poses diverse challenges .

112: [CLS] B ##io ##ener ##get ##ic capacity is critical to adapt the high energy demand of the heart to circa ##dian o ##s ##cilla ##tions and disease ##d states .

113: [CLS] A fundamental unit of neural com ##putation is the action potential . While significant advances have been made in the ability to sample action potential ##s of large numbers of individual neurons in animal models , translation of these method ##ologies to humans has been lacking due to clinical time constraints , electrical noise in the operating room , and reliability of the methodology . Here we present a reliable method for in ##tra ##oper ##ative recording of dozens of neurons in humans using the N ##eur ##op ##ixel ##s probe , yielding up to ~ 100 simultaneously - recorded single - units ( n = 59 ##6 across 11 recordings in 8 participants ) . Most single - units were active within 1 minute of reaching target depth , compatible with clinical time constraints . Cell pairs active close in time were spatial ##ly closer in most recordings , demonstrating the power to resolve complex co ##rt ##ical dynamics .

115: [CLS] Individuals who have Down syndrome ( t ##ris ##omy 21 ) are at greatly increased risk of developing Alzheimer ##s disease - dem ##ent ##ia . Alzheimer ##s disease is characterised by the accumulation in the brain of am ##yl ##oid - { beta } plaque ##s that are a product of am ##yl ##oid precursor protein , encoded by the AP ##P gene on chromosome 21 . In Down syndrome the first site of am ##yl ##oid - { beta } accumulation is within end ##oso ##mes and changes to end ##oso ##me biology occur early in disease .
